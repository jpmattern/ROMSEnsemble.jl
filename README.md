# ROMSEnsemble.jl

*ROMSEnsemble.jl* is used to run ocean model ensembles and perform ensemble-based data assimilation using the Regional Ocean Modeling System ([ROMS](https://www.myroms.org/)). It automates starting and stopping of ROMS simulations, modifying input files and extracting output, and it requires an existing ROMS setup and a computer with a workload manager, such as [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/).

## Issues and Discussions

Please use the issues page to report issues and the discussions page for discussions. *ROMSEnsemble.jl* was initially created and is till being used for my personal research, and I would be willing expand it, if there is interest.
